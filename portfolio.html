                    ENAIMCO is a software startup company with the mission of accelerating the oil and gas sector's journey 
                    to net zero using digital solutions. My work was primarily centered around the transshipment project,
                    where a simulation engine was developed to simulate millions of voyages to optimise for fuel economy 
                    (which reduces GHG emissions and costs) while keeping curtailment risk minimal.

                    <ul style="font-size:0.8em;">
                        <li>Transcribed a simulation engine made in Excel into Python, speeding up processing speed by a factor of 100 using 
                            JIT compilation and vectorisation (Pandas NumPy Numba) </li>
                        <li>Analysed historical wave data to developed probablistic wave insights to
                            incorporate data driven decision-making in the simulation engine, reducing vessel fuel consumption and carbon emissions by 15%
                            (i.e. if your current wave predictions are telling you XYZ, the software will advise you what's the probability that
                            specific events will occur)</li> (SciPy Plotly Dash)
                        <li>Generated scripts to automate my supervisor's life (i.e. generating prepatory sheets required for OrcaFlex, 
                            extracting data from summarised noon reports)</li>

                    Let's say we have a very important meeting to attend, and we <i>cannot</i> afford to be late. If the goal was purely to 
                    <i>not be late</i>, then a naive solution would be to arrive as early as possible, and then wait at the venue.
                    During our transit to the venue, we would travel at maximum speed (well within vehicular and regulatory limits, obviously)
                    and that would be <i>a solution</i> to the problem. It is not a fantastic solution, but it is <i>a solution</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are some obvious problems with this methodology? 

                    <ol>
                        <li>Arriving too early serves no practical purpose. Early is good, but only if its early <i>within reason</i></li>
                        <li>Maximum speed is usually not an efficient mode of travel, it burns more fuel than it necessary 
                            (unless we're going to be late, there's no justifiable reason to book it)
                        </li>
                    </ol>  
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li>Important meeting date – the date that the oilfield is going to cap out</li>
                        <li>arriving too early – there's not enough oil to pick up
                        </li>
                    </ul>  -->

                    Unfortunately, it is <i>the solution</i> employed by the transshipment side of things here to to avoid curtailment. 
                    The transshipment project is all about applying intelligence to the decision making process of this scheduling system.

                    The most challenging and rewarding part of this project is how open-ended it was. I really appreciated the opportunity to work 
                    alongside my beloved supervisor (a senior analysis engineer) and tag-team our way through all the uncertainties, trying to quantifying the chaotic nature of
                    dealing with offshore Newfoundland waves.  
                    
                    <!-- The project is very much open ended, which
                    prompted a lot of discussion regarding the problem itself, solution methodologies, potential avenues to explore, and future work.
                    I really enjoyed the freedom that entails with this project.  -->
