            <h2> A Brief Overview</h2>
            <div class="col-9" style="font-size:1.5em;text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> 
                My name is Derrick Tan and I'm a fresh mechanical engineering graduate as of May 2023. Well, that's what my degree says anyway. 
                I prefer to introduce myself as a data scientist pretending to be a mechanical engineer, because, <i>flair</i>, 
                and more importantly, it captures bits of my personality, capabitilites, and interests into one neat little package. 
                
                <br> <br>

                When Little Derrick was first introduced to computer science (CS) back in 2017 
                <i><small style="font-size: 0.5em";>(oh god that's almost a decade ago)</small></i> , he was like... 
                <br>
                <i style="text-align: center !important; display:block"  >"wait what? I can do this <b>for a living</b>?!".</i> 
                That class, ISC4U, was my first introduction to the world of CS, and it is probably my favourite class to date, mainly because I had
                the world's goofiest lecturer, and the course was about programming flash games (ActionScript 3.0). I created a little 
                platformer game, where you control a penguin and toggle between an inverted world to escape traps.

            <h2> Life Goals: !Happiness (...?) </h2>
            <div class="col-9" style="font-size:1.5em;text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;"> 
                If my goal in life was to be as happy as possible, I'd be a computer/data scientist of the sort. I really enjoy programming,
                especially when it comes to WYSIWYG programming or automating mundane tasks. But alas, I value something a bit more than 
                my sense of contentedness, and that would be my sense of <i>fulfillment</i>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would like to leave the world a better place than I found it, and I think a degree in engineering gives me the domain expertise
                and the leverage required to make that happen. Besides, I could always be a computer scientist by heart â€“ I reckon it doesn't work 
                the other way round.

            <h2> Favourite Word  </h2>
            <div class="col-9" style="font-size:1.5em;text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
<!--                 
                I like all things data. I find it absolutely fascinating that a bunch of algorithmns, equipped with the knowledge of historical
                data, can do so much. It's even more prominent in this day and age of ridiculous leaps in computational power & storage. 

                I aspire to become a machine learning/AI engineer of the sort, because I think it's one of the most powerful tools we have to 
                tackle complex problems.  -->
                
                Do you have a favourite word? Mine is... <i>lackadaisical</i>. I was once described as such by someone dear to me, almost
                a lifetime ago, and today I revel at how increasingly relevant it's become. 
                If you're unfamiliar with the term, it means 'carelessly lazy'. While it may not be the most appetizing portrayal, 
                it was very... 'me'. I believe that my entire fascination for all things programming, AI/ML, 
                and automation, stems from this nature of mine.

                Random Thoughts
                When someone tells you they like hiking, what goes through your head? 

                At the time I've merely dipped my toes into the 
                world of programming and I was not even considering 


                


                And that is a brief story of me. Lackadaisical. 

                
                
                This is probably one of my favorite words in the dictionary.

                For the unfamiliar, it means something along the lines of 'carelessly lazy'. 

                
                I really do not like doing drawn out monotonous tasks and would much rather figure out how to automate it with code.
