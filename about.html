                    My name is Derrick Tan and I'm a fresh engineering graduate as of May 2023 – well, that's what my degree says about me anyway. 
                    I prefer to introduce myself as a data scientist pretending to be an engineer, because, <i>flair</i>, 
                    and more importantly, it captures bits of my personality, capabitilites, and interests into one neat little package.
                </p> 

                <p>
                    I like to describe myself as a data nerd particularly interested in storytelling with data, automation scripting, 
                    and all things AI/ML. My digital playground currently consists of data science libraries with a hint of image processing (for the occasional automation 
                    with my android devices).  
                    
                    The bulk of my experience lies in:

                    - Scripting (openCV, Pillow with ADB)<br>
                    - Mechanical design (SolidWorks) <br>

                    fields approach their problems.  -->

                    sparked my interest for the field, and watching Andrew Ng's lectures made me realize 
                    I've finally found the passion I've been looking for.

                <p>
                    When Little Derrick was first introduced to computer science (CS) in 2017, he thought to himself: 
                    <i><small style="font-size: 0.5em";>(oh god that's almost a decade ago)</small></i>
                    <br>

                            "wait what? I can do this <b>for a living</b>?!"
                        </i> 

                    <figure style="width:20%; float: right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1.25em">
                        <img src="assets/guin.jpg" style="width:100%; border-radius: 5%;">

                    </figure>

                    That class, ICS4U, was my first introduction to the world of CS, and it is probably my favourite class to date, 
                    mainly because I had the world's goofiest lecturer, <i>and</i>, you get to program your very own flash game (ActionScript 3.0) –
                    I made a little platformer game featuring a penguin and it's inverted counterpart, guin. 
                    The process of building my own game made me view clicky-things (apps, games, websites, etc.) with a newfound lens,
                    I started to ask myself, <br>
                        <i style="text-align: center !important; display:block; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 0;"  >
                            "How would <b>I</b> build this software?

                <p>
                    <b>Magic</b>. That was what it felt like. For one, solutions were entirely dependent on your creativity. 
                    Even the jankiest solution could <i>sometimes</i> be the most elegant one due to its simplicity. 
                    
                    More importantly, previously-mundane tasks had suddenly become a puzzle. 
                    Programming has been one of my favourite things since, it felt like solving a maliciously-compliant puzzle that 
                    was <i>constantly</i> sassing me. <i><small style="font-size: 0.5em";>(see below: Derrick Discovers Casting)</small></i>

                    If my goal in life was to be as happy as possible, I'd be a computer/data scientist of the sort. I really enjoy programming,
                    especially when it comes to WYSIWYG programming or automating mundane tasks. But alas, I value something a bit more than 
                    my sense of contentedness, and that would be my sense of <i>fulfillment</i>. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to leave the world a better place than I found it, and I think a degree in engineering gives me the domain expertise
                    and the leverage required to make that happen. Besides, I could always be a computer scientist by heart – I reckon it doesn't work 
                    the other way round.

                I like all things data. I find it absolutely fascinating that a bunch of algorithmns, equipped with the knowledge of historical
                data, can do so much. It's even more prominent in this day and age of ridiculous leaps in computational power & storage. 

                I aspire to become a machine learning/AI engineer of the sort, because I think it's one of the most powerful tools we have to 
                tackle complex problems.  -->
                <p>
                    Do you have a favourite word? Mine is... <i>lackadaisical</i>. 
                    
                    
                </p> 
                <p>
                    I was once described as such by someone dear to me, almost
                    a lifetime ago, and today I revel at how increasingly relevant it's become. 
                    If you're unfamiliar with the term, it means <i>'carelessly lazy'</i>. While it may not be the most appealing of portrayals, 
                    it was very... 'me'. I believe that my entire fascination for all things programming, AI/ML, 
                    and automation, stems from this nature of mine.
                </p>

                    See, as a victim of long, drawn-out, repetitive tasks (also known as your first internship), I absolutely <b>dread</b> 
                    the idea of doing these monotonous tasks. I'd much rather spend hours trying create an automated solution, even
                    if doing it manually would only take me 30 minutes. It matters not how much time I have, I will never willingly 
                    do things manually.<i><small style="font-size: 0.5em";> (unless a quick cost-benefit analysis dictated necessity)</small></i>
                    
                    <br>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <i>Engagement.</i> The main difference was engagement. This was one of those things I've come to emphasize a lot, 
                    after spending much time pondering about <i>"what makes a great lesson?"</i> <br>

                </p> 
                <p>
                    Lackadaisical was an especially apt description of who I was at the time.
                    I was hounded with so much workload that laying back for a breather felt like a luxury I couldn't afford.
                    I was constantly drowning in work, so much so that favourite pastime became... doing nothing. 
                    It was even better if it was doing nothing with company.

                    world of programming and I was not even considering 


                    


                    And that is a brief story of me. Lackadaisical.
